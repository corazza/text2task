before going to the PLACE%, get the OBJECT/a and the OBJECT/b in any order
get the OBJECT/a and OBJECT/b to the PLACE%
first get OBJECT/a then get OBJECT/b, or first get OBJECT/b then get OBJECT/a, then go to the PLACE%
grab OBJECT/a then OBJECT/b, or OBJECT/b then OBJECT/a, and go to the PLACE%
once you get the OBJECT/a and the OBJECT/b visit the PLACE%
bring OBJECT/a and OBJECT/b to the PLACE% in any order
=
(OBJECT/a > OBJECT/b | OBJECT/b>OBJECT/a)>PLACE%
OBJECT/a>OBJECT/b>PLACE% | OBJECT/b>OBJECT/a > PLACE%

never hit AVOID%. get the OBJECT/a and OBJECT/b in any order to the PLACE%
before going to the PLACE%, get OBJECT/a and OBJECT/b in any order, but beware not to hit any AVOID%
first get OBJECT/a and OBJECT/b (avoid AVOID%), and then bring them both to the PLACE%
while avoiding AVOID%, bring OBJECT/a and OBJECT/b to the PLACE%
first: get OBJECT/a. second: get OBJECT/b. third: carry them to the PLACE%. but most most importantly never collide with AVOID%
=
(OBJECT/a&!AVOID% >OBJECT/b&!AVOID% | OBJECT/b&!AVOID%> OBJECT/a&!AVOID%) >PLACE%&!AVOID%
OBJECT/a&!AVOID% > OBJECT/b&!AVOID% > PLACE%&!AVOID% | OBJECT/b&!AVOID% > OBJECT/a&!AVOID% > PLACE%&!AVOID%

do the following in order: OBJECT/a, OBJECT/b, PLACE%
get the OBJECT/a and then OBJECT/b and then go to the PLACE%
get the OBJECT/a and OBJECT/b then go to the PLACE%
first get OBJECT/a then get OBJECT/b, then visit the PLACE%
=
OBJECT/a> OBJECT/b > PLACE%
(OBJECT/a > OBJECT/b) > PLACE%
OBJECT/a > (OBJECT/b > PLACE%)

circle between the PLACE/a, PLACE/b, and PLACE/c
patrol around the PLACE/a, PLACE/b, and PLACE/c
go to the PLACE/a then the PLACE/b then the PLACE/c and go back to the PLACE/a, repeat
=
(PLACE/a > PLACE/b > PLACE/c)+ | (PLACE/b > PLACE/c > PLACE/a)+ | (PLACE/c > PLACE/a > PLACE/b)+
(PLACE/a > PLACE/b > PLACE/c > PLACE/a)+

while patrolling the PLACE/a, PLACE/b, and PLACE/c, avoid the AVOID/a
circle PLACE/a and PLACE/b and PLACE/c but never hit the AVOID/a
avoid the AVOID/a at all costs. go to the PLACE/a, PLACE/b, and PLACE/c in any order, repeat
repeat PLACE/b, PLACE/c, PLACE/a, in any order, but never step on a AVOID/a
=
(PLACE/a&!AVOID/a > PLACE/b&!AVOID/a > PLACE/c&!AVOID/a)+ | (PLACE/b&!AVOID/a > PLACE/c&!AVOID/a > PLACE/a&!AVOID/a)+ | (PLACE/c&!AVOID/a > PLACE/a&!AVOID/a > PLACE/b&!AVOID/a)+

#(PLACE/c&!AVOID/a > PLACE/a&!AVOID/a > PLACE/b&!AVOID/a)+

never step on a AVOID/a and avoid the AVOID/b, visit the PLACE/a then PLACE/b then PLACE/c. return to PLACE/b
go to PLACE/a, PLACE/b, then PLACE/c. finally return to the PLACE/b. avoid the AVOID/as and AVOID/bs
=
PLACE/a&!AVOID/a&!AVOID/b > PLACE/b&!AVOID/b&!AVOID/a > PLACE/c&!AVOID/b&!AVOID/a > PLACE/b&!AVOID/b&!AVOID/a

repeat in any order: OBJECT/a, OBJECT/b, PLACE%
get OBJECT/a or OBJECT/b or go to the PLACE%, repeat
=
(OBJECT/a | OBJECT/b | PLACE%)+

before exiting through the PLACE%, grab the OBJECT%! never step on a MINE
without stepping on a MINE: collect the OBJECT% and get to the PLACE%
(in reverse order) PLACE% (avoid MINE) then OBJECT% (also avoid MINE)
=
OBJECT%&!MINE > PLACE%&!MINE

before exiting through the PLACE%, grab the OBJECT%! never fall into a TRAP
without falling into a TRAP: collect the OBJECT% and get to the PLACE%
do the following in reverse order: PLACE% then OBJECT%. avoid TRAPs though!
=
OBJECT%&!TRAP > PLACE%&!TRAP

go to the PLACE/a, then collect the OBJECT%. afterwards run to PLACE/a, and finally go to the PLACE/b
in reverse order: PLACE/b, PLACE/a, OBJECT%, PLACE/a
=
PLACE/a >   OBJECT% PLACE/a    >  PLACE/b

start from the PLACE/a and find the AREA/a. then find the AREA/b in the AREA/a. return to PLACE/a
=
PLACE/a>    AREA/a     >AREA/a&AREA/b  >PLACE/a

find the AREA/b in the AREA/a
=
AREA/a&AREA/b

find the AREA/a then find the AREA/b in the AREA/a
=
AREA/a > AREA/a&AREA/b

find the AREA/a then find the AREA/b
=
AREA/a > AREA/b

grab the OBJECT%. bring it to the PLACE%
collect the OBJECT%. bring the collected object to PLACE%
=
OBJECT% >PLACE%

find the OBJECT% in the PLACE%
pick up the OBJECT% from the PLACE%
go to the PLACE% and pick up the OBJECT%
enter the PLACE%. in there, find the OBJECT%
=
OBJECT%&PLACE%

find the OBJECT% in the PLACE/a, then bring it to PLACE/b
pick up the OBJECT% from the PLACE/a. leave it at PLACE/b
go to the PLACE/a and pick up the OBJECT% to bring it to PLACE/b
enter the PLACE/a. in there, find the OBJECT%. carry it to PLACE/b
=
OBJECT%&PLACE/a > PLACE/b

never leave the AREA/a
find the AREA/a. then, remain in AREA/a
find the AREA/a. remain inside AREA/a
find the AREA/a. then, remain inside AREA/a
find the AREA/a. remain inside AREA/a
find the AREA/a. then, remain in it
find the AREA/a. remain in it
find the AREA/a. then, remain inside it
find the AREA/a. remain inside it

go the the PLACE/a once, and then leave forever
=
(!PLACE/a)* > PLACE/a > (!PLACE/a)
