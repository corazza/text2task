in reverse order: PLACE/b, PLACE/a, OBJECT%, PLACE/a
=
PLACE/a >   OBJECT% PLACE/a    >  PLACE/b

start from the PLACE/a and find the AREA/a. then find the AREA/b in the AREA/a. return to PLACE/a
=
PLACE/a>    AREA/a     >AREA/a&AREA/b  >PLACE/a

find the AREA/b in the AREA/a
=
AREA/a&AREA/b

find the AREA/a then find the AREA/b in the AREA/a
=
AREA/a > AREA/a&AREA/b

find the AREA/a then find the AREA/b
=
AREA/a > AREA/b

grab the OBJECT%. bring it to the PLACE%
collect the OBJECT%. bring the collected object to PLACE%
=
OBJECT% >PLACE%

find the OBJECT% in the PLACE%

pick up the OBJECT% from the PLACE/a. leave it at PLACE/b
go to the PLACE/a and pick up the OBJECT% to bring it to PLACE/b
enter the PLACE/a. in there, find the OBJECT%. carry it to PLACE/b
=
OBJECT%&PLACE/a > PLACE/b

never leave the AREA/a
find the AREA/a. then, remain in AREA/a
find the AREA/a. remain inside AREA/a
find the AREA/a. then, remain inside AREA/a
find the AREA/a. remain inside AREA/a
find the AREA/a. then, remain in it
find the AREA/a. remain in it
find the AREA/a. then, remain inside it
find the AREA/a. remain inside it
=
(!AREA/a)* > (AREA/a)+
