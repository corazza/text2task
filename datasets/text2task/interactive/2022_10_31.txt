first either visit the BASE, go to the OFFICE and leave UP, or enter the BUILDING. then, find a ROCK
=
(BASE | OFFICE&UP | BUILDING) ROCK

first go UP, then find some COFFEE
=
UP COFFEE

find the KEY and bring it to the FOREST
=
KEY FOREST

bring KEYs to the BUILDING
=
(KEY BUILDING)+

four options: find MAIL (start looking to the LEFT), or find the KEY and leave LEFT, or just find the KEY, or find the DECORATION
=
LEFT MAIL | LEFT&KEY | KEY | DECORATION

in the beginning you have to either find the DOOR, a TRAP, or a ROCK. then, you must either leave the FOREST, find the KEY (again) or the TRAP. in the end find the MAIL and finally find a MINE
=
(TRAP | DOOR | ROCK) (!FOREST | KEY | TRAP) MAIL MINE

keep finding MAIL
=
(MAIL)+

repeat the following. first go to the DOOR, or to the FOREST and exit LEFT (multiple times if necessary). then, find the DECORATION in the BUILDING, or the GOLDMINE, or go UP or DOWN
=
((DOOR | LEFT&FOREST)+ (DECORATION&BUILDING | GOLDMINE | UP | DOWN))+

pick up the MAIL or move RIGHT in the GOLDMINE. then either get to the BASE, don't get to the BASE, go DOWN, or go LEFT. then either enter the BUILDING or the FOREST. finally find a MINE
=
(MAIL | GOLDMINE&RIGHT) (BASE | !BASE | DOWN | LEFT) (FOREST | BUILDING) MINE

first go LEFT over the MINE as many times as it takes. then simply don't be in the FOREST. afterwards go RIGHT over the TRAP and COFFEE. in the end, find a ROCK
=
(MINE&LEFT)+ (!FOREST)+ TRAP&RIGHT&COFFEE ROCK

keep not being in a FOREST and going DOWN
=
(!FOREST DOWN)+

pick up n DECORATIONs or go RIGHT
=
(DECORATION)+ | RIGHT

visit the OFFICE n times, or go to the FOREST n times
=
(OFFICE)+ | (FOREST)+
